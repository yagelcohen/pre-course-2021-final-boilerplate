# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Pre Course Project - Todo List ðŸ“‹

## introduction

In this final project I created a web application that allows writing tasks called
"TODO-LIST"
The application was created using three programming languages:
1. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
2. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
3. JavaScript language.

ToDo list is a simple web application to save Your daily tasks in order.

### Features
* Pick a date
* Add new task
